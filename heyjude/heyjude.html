         Hey jude, don't make it bad.
      <br>Take a sad song and make it better.
      <br>Remember to let her into your heart,
      <br>Then you can start to make it better.
      <br>Hey jude, don't be afraid.
      <br>You were made to go out and get her.
      <br>The minute you let her under your skin,
      <br>Then you begin to make it better.
      <br>And anytime you feel the pain, hey jude, refrain,
      <br>Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.
      <br>For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
      <br>By making his world a little colder.
      <br>Hey jude, don't let me down.
      <br>You have found her, now go and get her.
      <br>Remember to let her into your heart,
      <br>Then you can start to make it better.
      <br>So let it out and let it in, hey jude, begin,
      <br>Youre waiting for someone to perform with.
      <br>And don't you know that it's just you, hey jude, you'll do,
      <br>The movement you need is on your shoulder.
      <br>Hey jude, don't make it bad.
      <br>Take a sad song and make it better.
      <br>Remember to let her under your skin,
      <br>Then you'll begin to make it
      <br>Better better better better better better, oh.
      <br>Na na na na na ,na na na, hey jude...
